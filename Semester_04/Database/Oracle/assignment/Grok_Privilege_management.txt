-- Step 1: Create user Person2
CREATE USER Person2 IDENTIFIED BY p1234;
GRANT CREATE SESSION to Person2;

-- Step 2: Create user Person1
CREATE USER Person1 IDENTIFIED BY p5678;
GRANT CREATE SESSION, CREATE TABLE, CREATE VIEW, CREATE SYNONYM TO Person1;

-- Step 3: Create NEWSPAPER table under Person1
-- Connect as Person1 (in some DBMS, you may need to log in as Person1)
--CONN Person1/5678;

connect system/sys1234;

   alter user PERSON1

-- Step 4: Insert data into NEWSPAPER table as Person1
INSERT INTO NEWSPAPER (ID, Title, Publication_Date) VALUES (1, 'Daily News', TO_DATE('2025-05-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD'));
INSERT INTO NEWSPAPER (ID, Title, Publication_Date) VALUES (2, 'Morning Post', TO_DATE('2025-05-02', 'YYYY-MM-DD'));

-- Step 5: Grant SELECT and INSERT privileges to Person2
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON NEWSPAPER TO Person2;

-- Step 6: Connect as Person2 and perform operations

INSERT INTO Person1.NEWSPAPER (ID, Title, Publication_Date) VALUES (3, 'Evening Times', TO_DATE('2025-05-03', 'YYYY-MM-DD'));

-- Verify the updated table
SELECT * FROM Person1.NEWSPAPER;
