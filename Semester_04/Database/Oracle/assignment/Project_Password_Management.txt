--Here start B question 

b) To prevent a password from being reused, you can use one of two profile 
parameters: PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX or PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME. ‘These two parameters are 
mutually exclusive; if you set a value for one of them, the other must not be set 
to UNLIMITED’-justify the statement. 

Answer:

--lets create a profile and create a user to test

SQL> create profile C##change limit
  2  password_reuse_time unlimited
  3  password_reuse_max 3;

Profile created.

SQL> create user C##cng identified by cng;

User created.

SQL> grant create session to C##cng;

Grant succeeded.

SQL> alter user C##cng profile C##change;

User altered.


-- lets try to reuse password

SQL> password
Changing password for C##CNG
